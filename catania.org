Covered by lava in 1693 eruption

[In 1693, an eruption struck the city and buried its 16th-century
counterpart, which is still visible here and there in Catania. Two
rivers, Amenano and Lognina, as well as a whole lake named Nicito were
buried by lava, but several churches retain their access to this
lower, older level of the city. It is still possible to visit sections
of what has survived and is a must-see for those fascinated by the
mysteries of the past.]
